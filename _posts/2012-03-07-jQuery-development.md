My mindset on how to use and develop in jQuery has just changed dramatically. I watched Yehuda Katz's video on [Evented Programming](http://jquery14.com/day-11). Basically the idea he presents boils down to asking:

1. If this was natively supported, what would it look like?
2. Then writing the code to get the functionality you want, based on that.
3. Then write the code to implement the "browser code"

Amazing. This creates very reusable code and simplifies the code you do write.

I came across this video from Dan Webb's article on [data-* attributes](http://danwebb.net/2010/1/27/put-that-data-attribute-away-son-you-might-hurt-someone). It is also a great article and helps remember that we should try to keep the html as semantic as possible.

Great resources to checkout.
