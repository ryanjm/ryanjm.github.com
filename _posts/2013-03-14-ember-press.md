Maybe I'm just easily impressed, but I _really_ like Robin Ward's [Ember Press](http://emberpress.eviltrout.com/). It isn't really my kind of game, but it is a great example of a well written Ember application. Robin even wrote up [documentation](http://emberpress.eviltrout.com/docs/emberpress.html) for the Ember code (which looks amazing thanks to [Docco](http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/)).

If you are interested in learning Ember, definitely check it out.
