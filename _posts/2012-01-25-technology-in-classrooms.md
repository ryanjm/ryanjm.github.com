Cringely gets at a good point about student motivation and it's impact on learning. He is quoting a reader:

> "...I'm finding that the real key to student success is not so much how you teach but how you go about motivating students to want to learn..."

This plays a huge impact in the university where many professors are there for the research and not the students.

> But not every school can be a Stanford and even there, as at many research universities, much of the faculty doesn't really want to teach.

This is a good reminder for myself to cultivate the motivation to learn as much as scheduling time to learn.
