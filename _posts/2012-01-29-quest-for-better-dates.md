M and I try to go on a date every week or two. I've never been good about coming up with new things for us to try. My creativity extends to the newest movie or nearest bowling alley. Last night I suggested Dave and Buster's. I felt like after that experience I should write down two of the date lessons M and I have learned in 4 months of marriage.

## Regal Premium Experience

Basically RPX tries to fill the role between a normal movie theater and an IMAX. M mentioned they are basically trying to be an IMAX without paying for the name brand. It includes more speakers, with some behind the screen, and a larger format screen. Just shy of IMAX size.

For us this was not worth the $4 surcharge. The movie we watched, Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol, wasn't even in 3D. M did mention though, that this will decrease the chance of having little children in the theater, if you care about that type of thing.

## Dave and Buster's

M and I were commenting on the business model the whole time. How smart it is to exchange money for credits at a strange rate (5.4 credits per dollar) which helps emotionally disconnect you from the money. And I'm sure those drinking alcohol spend even more.

Then there is the psychology of it all. Games that are set up to make you feel like you are on the edge of winning big. Making lights line up, being able to jump high enough, or being able to push one more coin over the edge.

Then there is the ticket system with such prizes as an iPad 2 for 120,000 tickets. M and I did some quick math and with the money we spent there, we would have had to spend $3,000+ to have enough tickets to buy that. No thank you. Granted, we weren't playing all ticket games, but the disparity still exists.

Overall the experience was ok, but there weren't that many games that we were having "fun" with. The ones for tickets are based on chance or small skill (such as pushing a button at the right time), nothing engaging. The ones that we found "fun" didn't give tickets.

At the end of the day how much money was spent on a date does factor into the joy gained from it. Fun dates shouldn't be outrageously expensive.
