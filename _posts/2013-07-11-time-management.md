[Matt](http://mattgornick.com/) pointed me to a great slide share called [26 Time Management Hacks I Wish I'd Known at 20](http://www.slideshare.net/egarbugli/26-time-management-hacks-i-wish-id-known-at-20). I think it is a great list of reminders and some of them really stood out to me.

* Work more when you're in the zone. Relax when you're not.
* Work iteratively.
* Put meetings at the beginning of the day.
* Keep the same context throughout the day. Switching between projects/clients is unproductive.
* Always take notes.
