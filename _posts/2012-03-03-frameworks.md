I don't have much to add to this discussion right now, but I just wanting to point out that the next two years is going to be pretty exciting for the web development community. I think some great frameworks and design patterns will be built around CSS, JS, and API's. We already have some great frameworks for the server side, so extending that to client side will fill out the stack.

I think this will be a huge undercurrent in the ability for more applications to be moved to the web.
