I've been working on redoing the [OrangeQC](http://orangeqc.com "OrangeQC") website. It was good to put into practice some fo the stuff I was learning at the end of my time at Nelson Cash. I've done a lot of reading reguarding best practices for CSS and came across [OOCSS](http://oocss.org/) and [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/).

The basic idea is to build out your CSS so it is reusable. Smacss provides a suggested file structure to handle it:

~~~
/css
|- base.css
|- layout.css
|- module.css
|- state.css
|- theme.css
~~~

`Base` is for how your elements should look by themselves, no additional classes. `Layout` should be for laying out larger elements on the page. `Module` is for smaller elements that will be reused on multiple pages. `State` is for handling the various states those modules can be in. `Theme` is for modifying the look if you need a different style.

I've been using SASS and put these into a particals so that I could includ them. That is worked really well. In addition I've added a mixins class so I can put my sass mixins in one spot and took out state since I haven't had much of a need for it. I've also been using [Bourbon](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon) for some standard mixins.

As with everything it takes practice knowing how to layout modules and when/where/how to refactor. I'll be redoing the CSS on this site to give me some more practice.

There is some debate of if you should add additional classes to your html in order to style elements or if you should use sass to mixin your various styles for targetted elements. I'm still figuring out pros/cons, but for my projects I have full control over the html so I'd rather add a couple extra classes where needed and reduce the size of my css.

If you are getting tired of targeting every element on the page and doing custom styling for everything, check out SMACSS and OOCSS, they'll speed up coding and make life easier.
