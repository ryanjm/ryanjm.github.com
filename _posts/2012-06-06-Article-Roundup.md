Here are some of the great articles I've come across this week.

**[You Should Probably Send More Email Than You Do](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/05/31/can-i-get-your-email/)**

Patrick McKenzie gets into why it can be valuable to get into a user's inbox. It is a long article, but has enough nuggets of wisdom to warrant the time.

**[What I Learned From Increasing My Prices](http://www.extendslogic.com/business/what-i-learned-from-increasing-my-prices/)**

Ruben Gamez talks about using client surveys and phone calls to figure out how to split pricing tiers and how to charge for each.

**[UI vs UX: what's the difference?](http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2012/06/ui-vs-ux-whats-the-difference/?utm_source=loopinsight.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+loopinsight%2FKqJb+%28The+Loop%29)**

> UI is the saddle, the stirrups, and the reigns.  
> UX is the feeling you get being able to ride the horse, and rope your cattle.

Dain Miller talks about the differences of UI and UX and how they often get confused. I think he provides some great definitions and good food for thought for any small company.
