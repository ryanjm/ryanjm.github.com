This past week I've been working on getting organized and that includes going through Instapaper. I've been using it since 2009 and have articles from that year that I haven't read. There were about 400 articles marked as unread so I've moved them all into a seperate folder with the hope of going through them very slowly over time-while keeping up with the current ones. The articles I find really useful I'll add in a weekly round up.

[A billion dollar software tech company is founded every 3 months *in U.S.](http://blog.minming.net/post/35553963889/a-billion-dollar-software-tech-company-is-founded-every) - interesting list of some of the billion dollar companies that have come out in the past couple years.

[12 Ted talks for Entrepreneurs](http://www.shopify.com/blog/6553665-12-must-watch-ted-talks-for-entrepreneurs) - Some food for thought.

[SO's definitive guide to forms based website authentication](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/549/the-definitive-guide-to-forms-based-website-authentication).
