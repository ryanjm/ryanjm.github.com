Last week was the end of my position at [Nelson Cash](http://nesloncash.com). After working with the team there for a year, I was able to see them grow from 4 people meeting up in coffee shops, to 10 people moving into a new studio with custom desks. It was a privilege working with some of the best designers in the city.

I received great experience working with project managers, designers, and clients in how to (and not to) run projects. Consulting is a continual learning process and Nelson Cash provided me with the best education I could ask for.

For now I'm still in Chicago. I'm looking forward to networking with startups and consulting for them on iOS and Ruby on Rails projects. Chicago might not be the first city you think of when considering startups, but there is a great community here and I'm excited at the opportunities to help where I can.
