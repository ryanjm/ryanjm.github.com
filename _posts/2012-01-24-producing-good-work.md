From an article about David Oglivy and his habits as a copywriter.

> &nbsp;2. I spend a long time studying the precedents. I look at every advertisement which has appeared for competing products during the past 20 years. 

In development I know it is important to plan, but this puts a whole new view on it.

> &nbsp;5. Before actually writing the copy, I write down ever concievable fact and selling idea. Then I get them organized and relate them to research and the copy platform. 

> &nbsp;12. I am a lousy copywriter, but I am a good editor. So I go to work editing my own draft. After four or five editings, it looks good enough to show to the client. If the client changes the copy, I get angry-because I took a lot of trouble writing it, and what I wrote I wrote on purpose.
