  <h1>Listing Attributes</h1>

  <p>This past week I was working on a Ruby on Rails project where I needed to list out a lot of attributes of an object. The difficult part came in the fact that I didn&#39;t want to display the attribute if it wasn&#39;t set or was 0.</p>

<p>Originally I had:</p>

<p>When you start talking about 25 or 30 attributes you are printing out, some of which are nested, this gets to be a really ugly view. </p>

<p>The next step was to move this to a helper method.</p>

<p>This is better, but gets messy when I needed to change the formatting on some attributes and other attributes needed to be printed in a different format (percentages, dollar values, etc).</p>

<p>I wanted the solution to be as easy as defining hash of attributes and titles. They way I could just grab my attributes:</p>

<p>In order to define the additional information I created some <code>_string</code> methods which would return the right format or nil (which would get ignored later). For example:</p>

<p>I wanted to be able to control the way they got printed in the view since it changed depending on which view I was in. My goal was to be able to write the following.</p>

<p>Thus the method needed to return a hash which had the correct label (key) and value (value).</p>

<p>A couple injects later I have a clean function that does exactly what I wanted.</p>
