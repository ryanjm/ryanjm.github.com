  <h2 id="toc_2">Motivation</h2>

<p>Jekyll-bootstrap is meant to make it easier for technically-minded people to share their knowledge.</p>

<p>As a self-taught web-developer I am continually indebted to all the diligent people who share their knowledge, bug fixes, and lessons through blogging.</p>

<p>I always thought &quot;I should really share my experiences too&quot;, but I never manage to get past the mental obstacle of having to setup a wordpress install
and use some UI to write words. Then do I have to figure out how to highlight code or what?</p>

<p>The point is I&#39;m lazy <em>in that way</em>. I have 3 wordpress accounts, a posterous, a sinatra site, and a twitter,
all of which get updated once a year if I&#39;m feeling generous.</p>

<h3 id="toc_3">Jekyll is Different.</h3>

<p>Actually Jekyll was pretty damned frustrating when I started out - which is why I created Jekyll-bootstrap.
But aside from that, jekyll just feels right to me.</p>

<h3 id="toc_4">I want to write articles like I write code.</h3>

<p>So this time I feel like I&#39;ve got something here. This time I feel like Jekyll can finally be the motivation
I need - the convenience I crave - that gets me posting and sharing on a regular basis.</p>

<p>As for my first flurry of content, I would like to share everything I learned about using Jekyll<br>
<strong>- and that&#39;s Jekyll-bootstrap</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="toc_5">People</h2>

<p>Jekyll-bootstrap is maintained by me, <a href="http://plusjade.com">Jade Dominguez</a>.
I encourage everyone to check out the <a href="contribute.html">contribute</a> page if you are interested in helping. =)</p>

<p>Mostly I try to contribute to GitHub-backed projects because I have a not-so-secret
mission to somehow work for GitHub in the near future. I still need to plan my attack though.
But if anyone can help, please <a href="http://plusjade.com">contact me</a>!</p>
